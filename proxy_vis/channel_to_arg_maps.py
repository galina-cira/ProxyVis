"""
    Convenience module providing maps from satellite channels to function input.

    The following module provides constants that can be used as the data_to_args_map
    and vis_channel arguments of the combine_dn_pvis.get_all_vis_pvis function.
    These map the contents of the data_dict to the arguments of the desired ProxyVis
    function. The vis channel that should be used is also provided. Arguments
    are provided for every combination of ProxyVis function and supported
    satellites.  The names used here are the names provided by Satpy.  If you are
    using a different reader, then you will need to make your own mapping with the
    names provided by your reader.

    The contstants with "MAIN" in their name will map channels to the arguments of
    the ProxyVis "main" functions.  The constants with "SIMPLE" in their name will
    map channels to the arguments of the ProxyVis "simple" functions.
