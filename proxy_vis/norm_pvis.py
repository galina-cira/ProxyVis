    ProxyVis post-processing to make the final GeoProxyVis image more

    Args:
        tt_regr_pvis (np.ndarray): ProxyVis estimates before normalization
        saved_pvis_min (float): saved ProxyVis min values to use
        saved_pvis_max (float): saved ProxyVis max values to use
        use_saved_params (bool) Use saved ProxyVis params if True, otherwise,
        calculate ProxyVis min/max. ProxyVis min/max MUST be calculated from
        the full disk GEO data.

    Returns:
        proxy_vis (np.ndarray): Final normalized ProxyVis data
        pvismin (float): The minimum value used to normalize the ProxyVis data.
            If use_saved_params was True, then this value is the same as the
            passed min.  Otherwise, this is calculated as the min value in

        pvismax (float): The maximum value used to normalize the ProxyVis data.
            If use_saved_params was True, then this value is the same as the
            passed max.  Otherwise, this is calculated as the max value in
